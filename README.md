# Analyzing Weather Data to Find Similar Days

This method (called Grid Search) aims to maximize granularity during the process of searching for a similar day using ERA5 data. A day is characterized by parameters such as Dew Point, Temperature, and Wind Speed, which are represented as spatial time series. Considering one parameter, each data point for each hour of the day and for every station is compared with the corresponding hour and station of a different day. The Grid Search method utilizes matrices as data structures to capture all characteristics of a day and employs the Frobenius Norm to calculate the distance between days.

The algorithm begins by generating three matrices for each day within a given time period. These three matrices combined contain all the data for the respective day. Their dimensions are (number of stations * 24, the hours in a day) x (number of features) each. Essentially, the rows will represent data for all stations for the first hour of the day, then data for all stations for the second hour of the day, and so on. Vertically, the matrix is structured as 24 repetitions of the list of stations, where each repetition corresponds to a different hour of the day. Before generating these matrices, the stations are sorted to ensure consistency. The first matrix has columns for Dew Point and Temperature, the second matrix includes Global Horizontal Irradiance, Cloud Cover, and Direct Horizontal Irradiance, and the third matrix contains Wind Speed at 10 meters and Wind Speed at 100 meters. Depending on the input, any of these three matrices can be used to search for a similar day; however, even a single column can be utilized to compare days. During the generation of the matrices, the data within each column (feature) is normalized so that its Euclidean length (L2 norm) is 1. This normalization ensures that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations regardless of its original scale.

Once the matrices are generated and normalized, the next step involves comparing the target day’s selected matrix (one of the three generated) with the selected matrix of every other day in the dataset. This comparison is done using the Frobenius Norm. The distance is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of the elements’ differences between two matrices. This provides a single scalar value that represents the overall distance between the two days being compared.

The Grid Search algorithm also employs the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to provide more comprehensive results. The Grid Search method excels in identifying detailed weather patterns throughout the day. By using the Frobenius Norm to measure distances, it captures subtle variations and ensures precise matching, ideal for meteorological analysis and forecasting. However, its emphasis on pattern matching can sometimes lead to finding "similar" days with significantly different average weather values, which is a potential downside when average conditions are more relevant.
